# Cell Sketches

This is based on the angular-seed app. Directions for building it are below.

It has preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies for the project using npm and bower.

# Tech. Debts

* Need consistent way to handle points in 3D and 2D
* Bounding box of RC1 is odd in the Z-dimension. Structure with depth of 770?
* First attempt of cell cache needs to be deleted.
